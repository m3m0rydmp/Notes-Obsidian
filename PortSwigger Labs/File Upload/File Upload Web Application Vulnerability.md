It is when a web server allows to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on these could mean that even a basic image upload function can be used to upload arbitrary and potentially dangerous files instead. This could even include server-side script files that enable remote code execution.
In some cases, the act of uploading the file is in itself enough to cause damage. Other attacks may involve a follow-up HTTP request for the file, typically to trigger its execution by the server.

## Impact of File Upload Vulnerability
It generally depends on two key factors:
* Which aspect of the file the website fails to validate properly, whether that be its size, type, contents, and so on.
* What are restrictions are impose on the file once it has been successfully uploaded.
In the worst case scenario, the file's type isn't validated properly, and the server configuration allows certain types of file (such as `.php` and `.jsp`) to be executed as code. In this case, an attacker could potentially upload a server-side code file that functions as a web shell, effectively granting them full control over the server. If the filename isn't validated properly, this could allow an attacker to overwrite critical files simply by uploading a file with the same name. If the server is also vulnerable to directory traversal, this could mean attacker are even able to upload files to unanticipated locations.
Failing to make sure that the size of the file falls within expected thresholds could also enable a form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack, whereby the attacker fills the available disk space.

## Exploiting Unrestricted File Uploads to Deploy a Web Shell
From a security perspective, the worst possible scenario is when a website allows you to upload server-side scripts, such as PHP, Java, or Python files, and is also configured to execute them as code. This makes it trivial to create your own web shell on the server.

If you're able to successfully upload a web shell, you effectively have full control over the server. This means you can read and write arbitrary files, exfiltrate sensitive data, even use the server to pivot attacks against both internal infrastructure and other servers outside the network. For example, the following PHP one-liner could be used to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem:
```php
<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>
```

A more versatile web shell may look something like this:
```php
<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
```
This script enables you to pass an arbitrary system command via a query parameter as follows:
```http
GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1
```

## Exploiting Flawed Validation of File Uploads
Flawed file type validation
When submitting HTML forms, the browser typically sends the provided data in a `POST` request with the content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. This is fine for sending simple text like your name or address. However, it isn't suitable for sending large amounts of binary data, such as an entire image file or a PDF document. In this case, the content type `multipart/form-data` is preferred. 
Consider a form containing fields for uploading an image, providing a description of it, and entering your username. Submitting such a form might result in a request that looks something like this:
```HTTP
POST /images HTTP/1.1
    Host: normal-website.com
    Content-Length: 12345
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------012345678901234567890123456

    ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="example.jpg"
    Content-Type: image/jpeg

    [...binary content of example.jpg...]

    ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="description"

    This is an interesting description of my image.

    ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username"

    wiener
    ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456--
```
As you can see, the message body is split into separate parts for each of the form's inputs. Each part contains a `Content-Disposition` header, which provides some basic information about the input field it relates to. These individual parts may also contain their own `Content-Type` header, which tells the server the MIME type of the data that was submitted using this input.

One way that websites may attempt to validate file uploads is to check that this input-specific `Content-Type` header matches an expected MIME type. If the server is only expecting image files, for example, it may only allow types like `image/jpeg` and `image/png`. Problems can arise when the value of this header is implicitly trusted by the server. If no further validation is performed to check whether the contents of the file actually match the supposed MIME type, this defence can be easily bypassed using tools like Burp Repeater.

## Preventing File Execution in User-Accessible Directories
While its clearly better to prevent dangerous file types being uploaded in the first place, the second line of defence is to stop the server from executing any scripts that do slip through the net.

As a precaution, servers generally only run scripts whose MIME type they have been explicitly configured to execute. Otherwise, they may just return some kind of error message or, in some cases, serve the contents of the file as plain text instead:
```HTTP
GET /static/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1
    Host: normal-website.com


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/plain
    Content-Length: 39

    <?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
```
This behaviour is potentially interesting in its own right, as it may provide a way to leak soruce code, but it nullifies any attempt to create a web shell.

This kind of configuration often differs between directories. A directory to which user-supplied files are uploaded will likely have much stricter controls than other locations on the filesystem that are assumed to be out of reach for end users. If you can find a way to upload a script to a different directory that's not supposed to contain user-supplied files, the server may execute your script after all.
Web server often use the `filename` field in `multipart/form-data` requests to determine the name and location where the file should be saved.
Also note that even though you may send all of your requests to the same domain name, this often points to a reverse proxy server of some kind, such as a load balancer. Your requests will often be handled by additional servers behind the scenes, which may also be configured differently.

## Insufficient Blacklisting of Dangerous Files
One of the more obvious ways of preventing users from uploading malicious scripts is to blacklist potentially dangerous file extensions like `.php`. The practice of blacklisting is inherently flawed as it's difficult to explicitly block every possible file extension that could be used to execute code. Such blacklists can sometimes be bypassed by using lesser known, alternative file extensions that may still be executable, such as `.php5`, `.shtml`, and so on.

#### Overriding the Server Configuration
Servers typically won't execute files unless they have been configured to do so. For example, before an Apache server will execute PHP files requested by a client, developers might have to add the following directives to their `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` file:
```bash
LoadModule php_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp.so
    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
```

Many servers also allow developers to create special configuration files within individual directories in order to override or add to one or more of the global settings. Apache servers, for example, will load a directory-specific configuration from a file called `.htaccess` if one is present.

Similarly, developers can make directory-specific configuration on IIS servers using a `web.config` file. This might include directives such as the following, which in this case allows JSON files to be served to users:
```xml
<staticContent>
    <mimeMap fileExtension=".json" mimeType="application/json" />
    </staticContent>
```
Web servers use these kinds of configuration files when present, but you're not normally allowed to access them using HTTP requests. However, you may occasionally find server that fail to stop you from uploading your own malicious configuration file. In this case, even if the file extension you need is blacklisted, you may be able to trick the server into mapping an arbitrary, custom file extension to an executable MIME type.

#### Obfuscating File Extensions
Even the most exhaustive blacklists can potentially be bypassed using classic obfuscation techniques. Let's say the validation code is case sensitive and fails to recognize that `exploit.pHp` is in fact a `.php` file. If the code that subsequently maps the file extension to a MIME type is **not** case sensitive, this discrepancy allows you to sneak malicious PHP files past validation that may eventually be executed by the server.

You can also achieve similar results using the following techniques:
* Provide multiple extensions. Depending on the algorithm used to parse the filename, the following file may be interpreted as either a PHP file or JPG image: `exploit.php.jpg`
* Add trailing characters. Some components will strip or ignore trailing whitespaces, dots, and suchlike: `exploit.php.`
* Try using URL encoding (or double URL encoding) for dots, forward slashes, and backward slashes. If the value isn't decoded when validating the file extension, but is later decoded server-side, this can also allow you to upload malicious files that would otherwise be blocked: `exploit%2Ephp`
* Add semicolons or URL-encoded null byte characters before the file extension. If validation is written in a high-level language like PHP or Java, but the server processes the file using lower-level functions in C/C++, for example, this can cause discrepancies in what is treated as the end of the filename: `exploit.asp;.jpg` or `exploit.asp%00.jpg`
* Try using multibyte unicode characters, which may be converted to null bytes and dots after unicode conversion or normalization. Sequences like `xC0 x2E`, `xC4 xAE` or `xC0 xAE` may be translated to `x2E` if the filename parsed as a UTF-8 string, but then converted to ASCII characters before being used in a path.
Other defences involve stripping or replacing dangerous extensions to prevent the file from being executed. If this transformation isn't applied recursively, you can position the prohibited string in such a way that removing it still leaves behind a valid file extension. For example, consider what happens if you strip `.php` from the following filename:
```text
exploit.php
```
This is just a small selection of the many ways it's possible to obfuscate file extensions.

## Flawed Validation of the File's Contents
Instead of implicitly trusting the `Content-Type` specified in a request, more secure servers try to verify that the contents of the file actually match what is expected.
In the case of an image upload function, the server might try to verify certain intrinsic properties of an image, such as its dimensions. If you try uploading a PHP script, for example, it won't have any dimensions at all. Therefore, the server can deduce that it can't possible be an image, and reject the upload accordingly.

Similarly, certain types may always contain a specific sequence of bytes in their header or footer. These can be used like a fingerprint or signature to determine whether the contents match the expected type. For example, JPEG files always begin with the bytes `FF D8 FF`

This is a much more robust way of validating the file type, but even this isn't fool proof. Using special tools, such as `ExifTool`, it can be trivial to create a polyglot JPEG file containing malicious code within its metadata.

## Exploiting File Upload Race Conditions
Modern frameworks are more battle-hardened against these kinds of attacks. They generally don't upload files directly to their intended destination on the filesystem. Instead, they take precautions like uploading to a temporary, sandboxed directory first and randomizing the name to avoid overwriting existing files. They then perform validation on this temporary file and only transfer it to its destination once it is deemed safe to do so. 

That said, developers sometimes implement their own processing of file uploads independently of any framework. Not only is this fairly complex to do well, it can also introduce dangerous race conditions that enable an attacker to completely bypass even the most robust validation.

For example, some website upload the file directly to the main filesystem and then remove it again if it doesn't pass validation. This kind of behaviour is typical in websites that rely on anti-virus software and the like to check for malware. This may only take a few milliseconds, but for the short time that the file exists on the server, the attacker can potentially still execute it.

These vulnerabilities are often extremely subtle, making them difficult to detect during blackbox testing unless you can find a way to leak the relevant source code.

#### Race Condition in URL-Based File Uploads
Similar race conditions can occur in functions that allow you to upload a file by providing a URL. In this case, the server has to fetch the file over the internet and create a local copy before it can perform any validation.

As the file is loaded using HTTP, developers are unable to use their framework's built-in mechanisms for securely validating files. Instead, they may manually create their own processes for temporarily storing and validating the file, which may not be quite as secure.

For example, if the file is loaded into a temporary directory with a randomized name, in theory it should be impossible for an attacker to exploit any race conditions. If they don't know the name of the directory, they will be unable to request the file in order to trigger its execution. On the other hand, if the randomized directory name is generated using pseudo-random functions like PHPs `uniqid()`, it can potentially be brute-forced.

To make attacks like this easier, you can try to extend the amount of time taken to process the file, thereby lengthening the window for brute-forcing the directory name. One way of doing this is by uploading a larger file. If it is processed in chunks, you can potentially take advantage of this by creating a malicious file with the payload at the start, followed by a large number of arbitrary padding bytes.

## Exploiting File Upload Vulnerabilities Without Remote Code Execution
Most of the topics discussed so far is all about remote code execution when exploiting file upload. Though there are other way it can be exploited.

#### Uploading Malicious Client-Side Scripts
Although you might not be able to execute scripts on the server, you may still be able to upload scripts for client-side attacks. For example, if you can upload HTML files or SVG images, you can potentially use `<script>` tags to create stored XSS payloads.
If the uploaded file then appears on a page that is visited by other users, their browser will execute the script when it tried to render the page. Note that due to **same-origin policy** restrictions, these kinds of attacks will only work if the uploaded file is server from the same origin to which you upload it.
#### Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Parsing of Uploaded Files
If the uploaded file seems to be both stored and served securely, the last resort is to try exploiting vulnerabilities specific to the parsing or processing of different file formats. For example, you know that the server parses XML-based files, such as Microsoft Office `.doc` or `.xlsx` files, this may be a potential vector for XXE injection attacks.

#### Uploading Files Using PUT
It's worth noting that some web servers may be configured to support `PUT` requests. If appropriate defences aren't in place, this can provide an alternative means of uploading malicious files, even when an upload function isn't available via the web interface.
```HTTP
PUT /images/exploit.php HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-httpd-php
Content-Length: 49

<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/file'); ?>
```
You can try sending `OPTIONS` requests to different endpoints to test for any that advertise support for the `PUT` method.

## Remote Code Execution Via Web Shell Upload
[LAB: Remote code execution via web shell upload](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-web-shell-upload)
This lab is all about simple extraction for the content of `/home/carlos/secret`. There is a file upload in the `my-account` endpoint, any file upload will replace the profile picture. Since there is no restriction, we are to upload a file directly with a `.php` file type. The content of the file type should be like this
```php
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```
Once uploaded, this `.php` file will then be executed to exfiltrate the contents of `/home/carlos/secret`. Once the file is successfully uploaded, look at the HTML source page, and notice that the profile picture points to `/files/avatars/extract.php` means this is where we can find our `.php` script and it contains the secret of `/home/carlos/secret`

## Web Shell Upload Via Content-Type Restriction Bypass
[LAB: Web shell upload via content-type restriction bypass](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-content-type-restriction-bypass)
This lab only validates the `Content-Type` it does not accept any other `Content-Type` like `application/json`, `application/octet-stream`, etc. The response will give answer on what `Content-Type` it only accepts. There is no need to obfuscate the file type for this one. 

Replace the `Content-Type` to `image/jpeg` or `image/png` leave the file type as `.php` since it will be accepted. 
![](../../assets/PortSwigger%20Labs/File%20Upload/Pasted%20image%2020260205224710.png)
Once the file has been uploaded, inspect the HTML source page and the profile picture will point to `/files/avatar/extract.php`

## Web Shell Upload Via Path Traversal
[LAB: Web shell upload via path traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-path-traversal)
We need to use path traversal in order for this exploit to work. This time, we don't have to tamper the `Content-Type` and leave it as is. Login as `wiener:peter` and try the upload profile picture feature, then point it to `extract.php` which has the following code:
```php
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```
Now, we need to intercept the request when we click the **upload** button.

Trying a simple case payload of path traversal won't work because the server is stripping the directory traversal, although the response will tell us that the upload was successful but the script won't be executed to exfiltrate the content we needed. So I play around with URL encoding, a single URL encode works but only encode the `/` and leave the `..` as is. 
We need to find the `filename=` parameter in the `geckoformboundary` since this points where to place the file once uploaded. Then append the payload of the path traversal which would make it `filename=..%2fextract.php`. When you send that request, the response will tell us that it has been successfully uploaded at `avatars../extract.php` meaning that the file has been uploaded one directory up which is `/files/extract.php` instead of `/files/avatars/extract.php`.
![](../../assets/PortSwigger%20Labs/File%20Upload/Pasted%20image%2020260205231612.png)
If we look at the HTML source page of `my-account` it points to `/files/avatars/..%2fextract.php`, if we visit this we get an error saying the file does not exist in the server. So what went wrong?
If we are to access the file, we just need to use `/` but with `..` to traverse one directory up. So the `GET` request would be `GET /files/avatars/../extract.php` as stated on the response when we uploaded it, the file is in `avatars../extract.php`. 
![](../../assets/PortSwigger%20Labs/File%20Upload/Pasted%20image%2020260205231835.png)

## Web Shell Upload Via Extension Blacklist Bypass
[LAB: Web shell upload via extension blacklist bypass](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-extension-blacklist-bypass)
In this lab we simply just need to override the server configuration that the web server will execute our script as `.php` while not directly uploading it as a `.php`. A config file that Apache can't resist is `.htaccess`, it is an Apache configuration file that changes how the web server behaves in that directory.

So the first thing we need to do is to upload a `.htaccess` while passing a `.l33t` file extension. `.l33t` or (leetspeak) is an alternative alphabet used primarily in 1980s-1990s online subcultures, replacing letters with ASCII characters and numbers such as where 'e' becomes '3', 't' becomes '7'. Intercept the request where you will upload the file on the profile picture feature. In the `geckoformboundary` replace the `filename=` property to `filename=.htaccess` this will upload our own configuration of `.htaccess`. Then, replace the `Content-Type: text/plain` so that the web server will not reject our upload, this tells the web server that the file that we are about to upload is not a `.php` file. Below the `Content-Type` we put the following configuration so that the Apache server will execute it:
```text
AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t
```
This tells the web server to accept any file that ends with `.l33t` and execute it similar to `.php` file
![](../../assets/PortSwigger%20Labs/File%20Upload/Pasted%20image%2020260205233631.png)
Once we send that request, the server accepts it, and will say that the `.htaccess` has been uploaded successfully. Now, we can put our script to extract the secret of Carlos, but we will rename `extract.php` into a `extract.l33t` then the same payload will be inside the file to exfiltrate its secret.
![](../../assets/PortSwigger%20Labs/File%20Upload/Pasted%20image%2020260205233819.png)
The response will tell us that the file `extract.l33t` has been uploaded successfully. If we look at the HTML source page, we can see that the `src=` property of the profile picture now points to `src=/files/avatars/extract.l33t`. We can visit this, and we will exfiltrate the content.
